# Art-Generator-Final

We trained a variety of models. The one we use for generation is located in the dfcvae folder. A summary of this project/the project report is found in the pdf file.

Note that the models were all trained using the wikiart dataset, which is available here: TODO ADD LINK

## Deep Feature Consistent Variational Autoencoder (located in folder dfcvae/)
To run this, you will need to add a few folders. Create folders data/ runs/ samples/. In runs/, create folders checkpoints/ and logs/. Currently, the model is configured to run on three art categories. In the data/ folder, create a folder train3/. In that folder, create test/ and train/ folders. In each of these folders, add in 3 art style folders with the corresponding images.
